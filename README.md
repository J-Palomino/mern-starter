# MERN-Starter

Quickly get your next MERN app going with this template monorepo 🚀

### Development 💯

To get started with your development environment, do the
following:

-   Ensure that you have Node.js installed
-   Ensure that you have a local instance of mongodb running
-   Clone the repository
-   Run `npm install` to install all of the project
    dependencies
-   Run `npm start` to start the development server

And you're all set! Now get to writing some code 🚀

### Scripts 📝

The following scripts will help rapidly speed up your
development time:

-   `npm run start` : Starts a development-ready server on
    your machine
-   `npm run lint` : Runs linting check across the project
    source files
-   `npm run test` : Runs the tests using jest across the
    project source files (either :client or :server can be
    appended to target a specific end of the project as
    well)
-   `npm run validate` : Runs both linting and tests
-   `npm run clean` : Removes any installed node modules and
    installs them
